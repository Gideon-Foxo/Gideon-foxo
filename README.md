> Kettu has been my main project over the past few years and it is currently the largest SFW furry Discord bot serving over 4,100 servers. It was created in Jan 2020, when virtually no sfw Furry bots existed. Kettu is now on its 4th rewrite and uses a custom fork of Discord.js and a custom API. From a plethora of social commands, powerful moderation tools, anti-raidmode, logging and more, Kettu is a powerful bot in the right paws üêæ

### üê∂ [Furry Bot List](https://github.com/Gideon-foxo/furry-bots) 
> Inspired from [advaith1 top bots list](https://gist.github.com/advaith1/451dcbca2d7c3503d4f48d63eb918cb0), furry bot list is a list of all the publicly verified and maintained furry Discord bots. It is generally updated a few times a month and contains useful information such as developer, bot library's, growth direction and more

### ‚ùì [Support Bot](https://github.com/Gideon-foxo/support-bot) 
> Support Bot is a lightweight automated help desk built to streamline support systems. Users can interact with it and can get answers to commonly asked questions or seek extra support if their question isn't answered. This helps eliminate users asking the same question for the 10000th time or users who can't read pinned messages or faqs. This is one of my first open source projects built to be used in my own support servers.

> FurBot was one the largest and oldest furry bots on Discord, but it was shut down on 23-05-2022. FurBot foxo edition is a modern remake built with discord.js v14 a rethink db. You can self host it and choice either text or slash commands or use the publicly hosted instance called FurBoi. More commands will be ported over as time goes on.

> Lurking Racoon was my very first coding project ever. It was built for my main server I was running to do some very specific custom functions. From there, I just never stopped adding to it and I built it out more and more and then started working on other projects. It was never my goal to learn coding to build anything more than that, but yet here I am. As for first time coding projects go its horrendous. The very first version would throw memory leak errors whenever you booted it. Whoops! Enjoy laughing or cringing with me at this old archive.
