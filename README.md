## Kettu <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/685932693908881408/a_97e6f3aa2079900cc95aeb63ae86cbd4.gif" width="25" height="25" />

Kettu is my main project. Kettu is a small, fully safe for work Discord bot made in JavaScript. Kettu was born because all of the other furry have nsfw for them and the bot we where using even the sfw commands would return suggestive content and I never wanted to have to worry about it. So, after some time, the kettu was made. The word `kettu` stands for fox in Finnish. Kettu is not open source, however the documentation is and you can find it [here](https://github.com/LachlanWalls/kettu-docs). You can find Kettu's website [here](https://kettu.cc/).

## Lurking Racoon <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/600669425263181850/e5ee8243d18f13ecae936b6b15de4445.png?size=4096" width="25" height="25" />

Lurking Racoon was my very first coding project soooooo as expected the code for it is very bad. Lurking Racoon was a custom bot for a furry server I used to own. I was frustrated at the inflexibility of other bots at the time to do what I wanted so, with the help of some friends and contacts Lurking Racoon was born. You can really see how my coding improved from v1 to v2 and v3. My code defiantly does not look like what Lurking Racoon is anymore. The bot itself is no longer ran. The server itself that the bot is made for still exists however.
