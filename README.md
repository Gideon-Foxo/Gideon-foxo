<h2 align="center">Projects</h2>

### [Kettu](https://github.com/kettubot) <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/685932693908881408/a_97e6f3aa2079900cc95aeb63ae86cbd4.gif" width="25" height="25" />

> Kettu has been my main project and currently is my only publicly listed Discord bot. It was created because at the time finding a pure and good sfw furry bot was just impossible and it has since grown to be the largest purely sfw furry bot. Kettu is not open source, you can find more information about kettu at [kettu.cc](https://kettu.cc)

### [Support Bot](https://github.com/Gideon-foxo/support-bot) 

> This is my latest project and my first fully open source one! It is a simple and lightweight automated support desk to help answer commonly asked questions.

### [Lurking Racoon](https://github.com/Gideon-foxo/Lurking-Racoon) <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/600669425263181850/e5ee8243d18f13ecae936b6b15de4445.png?size=4096" width="25" height="25" />

> Lurking Racoon was my very first coding project for my private community server at the time and as such with first time projects the code is less then ideal. In fact, it was throwing memory leak errors! Feel free to take a look at this first time creation. Please do not think about using any of its code, seek help instead >.>

### [Furry Bot List](https://github.com/Gideon-foxo/furry-bots) 

> This is a detailed list at all of the publicly available and maintained furry Discord bots. I did this purely for fun to see how my own creation was doing next to all the other ones. And so this list was born c:

> [Develon](https://gitlab.com/Develon5543), thank you for helping me grasp some of the fundamentals of programming and helping me and giving me hope and insperation when I was to my end in frustration. Without you I never would have continued programming.
