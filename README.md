### [Kettu](https://github.com/kettubot) <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/685932693908881408/a_97e6f3aa2079900cc95aeb63ae86cbd4.gif" width="25" height="25" />

> Kettu is my main project and is currently my only publicly listed Discord bot. At the time there simply wasn't a good clean furry bot. Kettu was then born and has since grown to be the largest purely sfw furry bot on Discord. You can learn more about Kettu [here](https://github.com/kettubot).

### [Discord Bot Console Logger](https://github.com/Gideon-Foxo/dbot-console-logger)

> A simple and customizable package for styilezed console logs primailly made for Discord bots.

### [Support Bot](https://github.com/Gideon-foxo/support-bot) 

> This is my first open source project. It is a simple and light weight automated support desk to help answer commonly asked questions.

### [Furry Bot List](https://github.com/Gideon-foxo/furry-bots) 

> This is a detailed list at all of the publicly available and maintained furry Discord bots. I did this purely for fun to see how my own creation was doing next to all the other ones. And so this list was born c:
